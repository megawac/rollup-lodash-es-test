Just testing methods of using rollup to bundle a package leveraging lodash (https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/914)

`example-direct.js` is an attempt at importing a `lodash-es` method directly (`import map from 'lodash-es/collection/map') while `example-main.js` attempts to load it all and cherry pick a select method.
